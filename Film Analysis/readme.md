# Project Description

I will share sample outputs from a recent online course that I have taken. Using the film project, we will see how SQL is being applied in a practical business set-up, as well as what requirements should be presented to your stakeholders. The basic deliverable for analysts using SQL in their daily tasks would be the extracted tables from a large datalake. However, while this is the main output requested, it would be helpful to prepare your supporting materials as some stakeholders may use it as reference. It would be ideal to present the flow on how multiple tables were connected, the SQL syntax used to filter the data with clear documentation of its business request or context, and the extracted tables.
While your end users will focus on the already extracted tables, it would be a good reference for them and a good practice for you as a data analyst to keep a clean documentation of the syntax and the business case/situation used. A well-kept documentation will also be helpful in case you need to make changes or revisit the process in the future. Moreover, it will be a good reference for your colleague if ever they will need to take over the project.
