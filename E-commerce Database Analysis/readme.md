- Compare marketing channels, understand relative performance, optimize a channel portfolio, and analyze trends

-- BUSINESS CONCEPT: TRAFFIC SOURCE ANALYSIS
-- *******************************************

/* Traffic source analysis is about understanding where your customers are
coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic */

/*UTM TRACKING PARAMETERS*/
/*When businesses run paid marketing campaigns, they often obsess over performance and measure everything; 
how much they spend, how well traffic converts to sales, etc.
Paid traffic is commonly tagged with tracking (UTM) parameters, which are appended to URLs and allow us 
to tie website activity back to specific traffic sources and campaigns

- We use the utm parameters stored in the database to identify paid website sessions
- From our session data, we can link to our order data to understand how much revenue our paid campaigns are driving
 */

/*COMMON USE CASES:
• Analyzing search data and shifting budget towards the engines, campaigns or keywords driving the strongest conversion rates
• Comparing user behavior patterns across traffic sources to inform creative and messaging strategy
• Identifying opportunities to eliminate wasted spend or scale high-converting traffic */
